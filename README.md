Academic Project for ISEN Engineering Data Analysis

## INTRODUCTION

Today we live in the era of information, a fast-paced and completely dynamic environment, where every choice plan or strategy, either in industry or by individuals, are based on informed decisions. Part of this informed decisions have to do with the ability to identify and predict future behavior of different items and issues.

Brooklyn is the neighborhood of New York City that has developed de most in the last ten years. Since 2006 real estate prices have increased significantly. In 2006 the average price per square foot for condos and townhouses were approximately $330. In 2017 average price per square foot for properties of the same time was approximately $950.  The low availability and the increasing demand has made Brooklyn properties to hit record numbers. In the first quarter of 2018, median selling price rose to $800,000, a 3.5% increase from previous prices.

If in need to purchase a property in the area, it is extremely important to be able to predict what the actual price for a home is, so that one can find better opportunities, and also no overpay for properties with inflated prices.
For this project we analyzed a data set corresponding to Brooklyn, NY housing market. Planning has become a basic need of this decade. Planning allow both individuals and organizations to avoid undesired situations, gain better economic stability and thus, obtain a better quality in operations and living. 

The goal of our study is to be able to predict future home prices, and later understand how different attributes positively or negatively affect house prices in the neighborhood of Brooklyn.
